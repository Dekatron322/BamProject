            up for a real estate app:

              "Politely request they provide the property ID for your rental unit. This is usually a unique number assigned to each property managed by the landlord or property management company.",
              "If they don't know what it is, explain that it may be listed on your lease agreement, or they can contact the property management company to lookup the ID.",

              "Sign up for the real estate app and enter the property ID when prompted during registration. This will link your account to the specific rental property.",
